# Water Prediction Ft.KRS Reservoir
- This is the Project ,I developed with my Team CodePanchayathi for a Hackathon conducted by the **World Resources Institute(WRI)** in association with **Microsoft** and **BlackRock** .

## Agenda:
- To develop predictive model that can strengthen water resources planning and risk preparedness for cities.  Using cutting-edge data and innovative technology solutions these emerging data specialists and analysts can help find solutions to emerging and urgent environmental challenges.

- To address the above-mentioned information gap, I am  developing a predictive model that estimates reservoir water availability at least 1-3 months in advance using hydro-meteor ological parameters and reservoir water level data. Paired with historical and real-time data, these future indicators on reservoir-specific water availability developed using deep-learning technologies can facilitate effective and efficient water resource management by reservoir operators and water departments.

## About the Model :
- I used LinearRegression for predicting the water availability in the Reservoir .
  
## Selection of Features(Independent variables) :
 -  **R^2-Score** was used for Obtaining the Correlation between the dependent and independent variables.
 -  It shows the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).

## Key Observations :
- I found out that **RESERVOIR_water_level** was more dependent on the rains in the nearby cities and towns ,through which the river flows ,of Bangalore than the **INFLOW and OUTFLOW Cusecs** .
